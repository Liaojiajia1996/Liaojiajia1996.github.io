Team members ：https://sites.google.com/view/econ4biodiv/team <br>

Commencing in September 2023, I formally became a member of the Biodiversity Laboratory at the National Institute for Environmental Studies in Japan. This laboratory is renowned for its strong academic ethos and research-oriented environment. The team is dedicated to conducting research on "**Leveraging Human Behavior for Biodiversity Conservation**," with a steadfast commitment to the preservation and sustainable utilization of natural ecosystems.<br>

Our research primarily focuses on Biodiversity conservation, Wildlife trade, and the assessment of Recreational value in National parks. We employ a diverse array of methodologies, including software coding, field investigations, and mathematical modeling, to strike a harmonious balance between biodiversity conservation and the study of human behavior associated with recreational activities.
