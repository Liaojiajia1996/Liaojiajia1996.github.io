## OpenIoT Team

生物多様性領域 [生物多様性保全計画研究室](https://sites.google.com/view/econ4biodiv/home)

Commencing in September 2023, I formally became a member of the Biodiversity Laboratory at the National Institute for Environmental Studies in Japan. This laboratory is renowned for its strong academic ethos and research-oriented environment. The team is dedicated to conducting research on "**Leveraging Human Behavior for Biodiversity Conservation**," with a steadfast commitment to the preservation and sustainable utilization of natural ecosystems.<br>

Our research primarily focuses on Biodiversity conservation, Wildlife trade, and the assessment of Recreational value in National parks. We employ a diverse array of methodologies, including software coding, field investigations, and mathematical modeling, to strike a harmonious balance between biodiversity conservation and the study of human behavior associated with recreational activities.<br>

The team places a significant emphasis on fostering external collaborations and maintains robust partnerships with esteemed research institutions such as Kyoto University, Sophia University, the University of Oxford, and the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.<br>

In our pursuit of biodiversity conservation research, we are constantly on a journey towards our goal. Our mission is to tirelessly promote the harmonious coexistence of humans with nature, among humans themselves, and within society. We aim for a virtuous cycle of comprehensive development, sustainable prosperity, and enduring well-being.
